## Deliverable - Update 1:
**Have you made any new ideas?**
Our team, Tesseract, has come up with a crude idea to help enhance the relations between doctors and their patients by building a strong communication interface with seamless information transfer system with the feature of online consultation.

**As a team, write a brief paragraph about what problem your team is trying to solve?**
Even though the 21st century has shown us the advancements in technology in the field of communication, the doctor-patient relations have stayed the same and through our application we aim to improve the relations to better the diagnoses and improve overall relationship. Our application improves that relation and helps doctors reach out to their patients whenever required and also monitor their health and well being. With covid-19, becoming a global pandemic and lockdowns being imposed in many countries, it has become an ordeal to visit hospitals and consult a doctor and so to overcome this problem, we have developed an application which provides online consulting with doctors who are in the vicinity of the patients so the patients need not visit hospitals and can stay safe.
